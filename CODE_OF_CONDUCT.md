We expect all MPIA organization projects to adopt a code of conduct
that ensures a productive, respectful environment for all open source
contributors and participants. We are committed to providing a strong and
enforced code of conduct and expect everyone in our community to follow these
guidelines when interacting with others in all forums. Our goal is to keep ours
a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community. The community of
participants in open source Astronomy projects is made up of members from
around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences.
It is through these differences that our community experiences success and
continued growth.

The Max Planck Society expects all staff, scientists, directors,
guests, and partners to adhere to the following principles:

1. Our mission is to conduct cutting-edge, fundamental
research for the benefit of all humankind, in keeping with
our motto: „Insight must precede application“.
The Max Planck Society looks back on a long tradition
of performing high-risk highreward fundamental research.
We are committed to giving our scientists the best
possible conditions for conducting their research in our
Institutes. Despite the diverse research interests of our
scientists, we all pursue a common goal: understanding
the world around us for the benefit of all humankind.

2. We treat each other with respect and do not tolerate
any forms of discrimination based on ethnicity, gender,
disability, religion or belief, age or sexual orientation
or identity.
Discrimination has no place in the Max Planck Society:
not in the lab, not in the workshop, the office or during the
hiring process. We believe that science is a diverse
endeavor: diversity provides new impulses, new ideas,
new perspectives and innovation.

3. We conduct our research and support the research
of others with integrity and according to the highest
scientific standards.
We are committed to scientific integrity and abiding by
the guidelines of good scientific practice. We value
scientific quality over quantity. To monitor our progress
and standards, we invite external experts (Scientific
Advisory Board) on a regular basis to evaluate the quality
of our research and the state of our Institutes.

4. We discuss problems and implement solutions openly
and respectfully; we communicate the principles and
processes that underlie our actions and decisions.
We are committed to providing a work environment within
our Institutes in which all employees feel valued and know
they can address problems openly without fear of reprisal.
When issues arise within the Institute or the Society,
we discuss them openly and respectfully with the goal
of finding a solution amenable to all parties.

5. We recognize the achievements of others, give
credit where it is due and offer constructive feedback
when necessary.
Science and innovation depend on an open and constructive discourse in which new ideas can be freely exchanged
and old wisdoms challenged. Thus, we discuss our
research openly and criticize constructively. We give credit
to those who help us with their ideas and their criticism.
We recognize that the people who support our scientists in
the labs, the administration and the workshops are integral
to the success of the Max Planck Society. We take pride in
the achievements of the scientists and staff of the
Institutes and the Society. 

6. We support each other in achieving our goals by nurturing
trust and cooperation, and by respecting individual
capabilities and needs.
We are aware that research is often highly competitive and
people can feel under pressure to produce results.
Because of these circumstances, we are committed to
being mindful of personal boundaries and contributing
to a nurturing work environment based on trust and mutual
respect. 

7. We honor our responsibilities towards our colleagues,
employees, the public, and the environment by acting
supportively and sustainably.
We are committed to supporting each other scientifically,
in matters of leadership and mentoring, as well as career
development. We are aware that our research is predominantly funded by the taxpayer and respect the boundary
conditions of public funding. Whenever possible we pledge
to conduct our research in an environmentally sustainable
fashion. 

8. We communicate openly and transparently with each
other and with the public.
Scientific discovery must be communicated in order for it
to be valued by the public. Since we are predominantly
funded by the public while also benefitting from private
donations, we see it as our obligation to inform the public
openly and transparently about our research. We use many
different channels for our public outreach: newspa-pers,
websites, social media, public lectures, tours of the
Institutes or educational programs.

Any violations of the Code of Conduct should be reported to the 
MPIA GitHub organizations owners, 
MPIA conflict coaches, directors or equal opportunity officers.
